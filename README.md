# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a movie recommendation system built using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and Flask. The system suggests movies based on user preferences and demonstrates the ability to handle datasets and implement algorithms.

## Features

* Recommends movies based on user preferences.
* Uses TF-IDF vectorizer to convert movie overviews into numerical features.
* Calculates cosine similarity to determine movie similarity.
* Provides a recommendation function to retrieve similar movies.
* (Optional) Flask web application for user interaction.

## Technologies

* Python
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* Flask (optional)

## Datasets

* tmdb_5000_movies.csv
* tmdb_5000_credits.csv

These datasets are included in the repository and contain information about movies and their credits.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create a requirements.txt with dependencies such as pandas, scikit-learn, flask)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python file to use the recommendation system.
4. (Optional) Deploy the Flask web application for user interaction.

## Example

To see recommendations for a movie, try the following:
